                    <p>I recently graduated from the University of Vienna with a master's in Austrian Studies. For my thesis, 
                    I wrote about the terms and concepts of Mikhail M. Bakhtin. Some of my interests include the German language, 
                    Slavic Languages (Czech & Russian), poetry, movies, and the translation of literary and 
                    philosophical texts.

                    Prior to studying at the University of Vienna, I worked as an English Teaching Assistant 
                    in Austria, which was made possible by the Austrian-American Educational Council. In 2014, 
                    I graduated from Knox College (in Galesburg, IL) with a B.A. in Philosophy and a minor in German.

                    Two days after finishing my master's, the quarantine began. I have used that time to 
                    learn to code and build websites, read Russian literature, and write. I also bought
                    a kettlebell and have been swinging that around for the past few months.
