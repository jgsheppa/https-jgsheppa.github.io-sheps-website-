                        Indignation, anger, and dissatisfaction are always 
                        unilateral: they exclude the one toward whom they 
                        are directed, and so forth; they evoke reciprocal  
                        anger. They divide, while laughter only unites;  
                        it cannot divide. Laughter can be combined with 
                        profoundly intimate emotionality [...] Everything 
                        that is truly great must include an element of laughter. 
                        Otherwise it becomes threatening, terrible, 
                        or pompous; 
                        in any case, it is limited. Laughter lifts the barrier and 
                        clears the path." - M. M. Bakhtin</figcaption>

                        Mikhail M. Bakhtin was a Russian philosopher. He is best known for his works on Rabelais  
                        and Dostoevsky, the concept of the chronotope in the novel, and speech-genres in  
                        communication. Bakhtin’s concepts often outshine his biography, despite the crucial role  
                        Bakhtin’s lived experience playing in his writings. For my master’s thesis, I wrote a glossary  
                        which included eleven of Bakhtin’s concepts, and placed these concepts 
                        within the context of Bakhtin’s writings and Bakhtin’s reality of Stalinist Russia. After finishing my 
                        thesis, I am still committed to working with Bakhtin and his writings. For the past year I have been learning 
                        Russian, in order to read Bakhtin in his own language. If you are interested in looking at my thesis,
